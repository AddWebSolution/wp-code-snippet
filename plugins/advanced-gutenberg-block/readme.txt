2. **Configure Block Settings:**
   - Each block supporting custom repeaters will have specific settings to map with your repeater fields.
   - Look for block settings related to custom repeaters in the block sidebar or settings panel.

3. **Dynamic Content:**
   - The content added through custom repeaters can be dynamic and adjustable based on your needs.
